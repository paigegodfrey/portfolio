          I'm an analytical thinker with a passion for learning and desire to be challenged.

          My background in finance has given me a unique perspective on problem solving and 
          process improvement. After graduating from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 2013, I held various 
          corporate/manufacturing finance positions at Chevron, entering through the company’s 
          Finance Leadership Development Program.

          My experience with budget stewardship, business planning, project management, and 
          internal controls helped develop my business acumen, but I found myself most interested 
          in building Excel models and figuring out how to automate tasks. The more I worked with 
          these tools, the more I understood their limitations, which led me to seek out different 
          technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          After months of soul-searching, attending meetups, and talking with folks in the industry, 
          I decided to pursue software engineering so I could spend my days using logic and creativity to 
          solve complex problems in an innovative environment. At the beginning of 2020, I enrolled 
          at Rithm School — a 16-week, full-time program focused on React, Node, Python, PostgreSQL, and data 
          structures. After working on personal projects and interning at JumpOffCampus, I feel comfortable 
          contributing to large codebases and working with a variety of tech stacks.

      <h2 class="font-weight-normal">Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding I like to stay physically active! I grew up doing Tae Kwon Do, earning my Second-Degree
        Black Belt before leaving for college. Moving up and down the West Coast with Chevron made it difficult to
        maintain a rank-based sport, so I've since taken up weight lifting and yoga.
