          I'm an analytical thinker with a passion for learning and desire to be challenged.

        <p>
          My background in finance has given me a unique perspective on problem solving and 
          project management. After graduating from Cal Poly SLO in 2013, I spent 6 years 
          working for Chevron in various corporate/manufacturing finance positions, entering through
          the company’s Finance Leadership Development Program.

        <p>
          My experience with budget stewardship, business planning, and internal controls helped develop 
          my business acumen, but I found myself most interested in building customer-facing tools and 
          figuring out how to automate tasks. After months of soul-searching, attending meetups, and talking 
          with folks in industry, I decided to pursue software engineering so I could spend my days using 
          logic and creativity to solve complex problems. At the beginning of 2020, I enrolled at Rithm School 
          — a 16-week, full-time program focused on React, Node, Python, PostgreSQL, and data structures. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After working on personal projects, interning at JumpOffCampus, and teaching computer science 
          students at CodePath, I feel comfortable contributing to large codebases and working with a 
          variety of tech stacks.

      <h2 class="font-weight-normal">Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding I like to stay physically active! I grew up doing Tae Kwon Do, earning my Second-Degree
        Black Belt before leaving for college. Moving up and down the West Coast with Chevron made it difficult to
        maintain a rank-based sport, so I've since taken up weightlifting and yoga.
